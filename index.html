    <h2>I love to create products<br />
        That enrich the lives of others
    </h2>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I began my journey in the digital space by managing the delivery and ongoing use of several digital products.  These include Tableau dashboards for data analytics, a custom phone app, a web-based TV content platform, and a custom HubSpot integration.  I also managed strategies for ongoing digital engagement with these products.  One strategy led to 100% growth in usership on our app.</p>
        <br />
        <p>I loved using these tools to help others accomplish their goals so much, I decided to learn how to build these tools myself!</p>
        <br />
        <p>Welcome to my journey. You'll get to see my all the projects I've been working on along the way.</p>
